## Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is a table that helps assess a classification model's performance. It breaks down predictions into:

- **True Positives (TP)**: Correctly predicted positives.
- **False Positives (FP)**: Incorrectly predicted positives.
- **True Negatives (TN)**: Correctly predicted negatives.
- **False Negatives (FN)**: Incorrectly predicted negatives.

## Classification Report

The classification report provides a detailed summary of a model's performance for each class, including:

- **Precision**: Accuracy of positive predictions.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Ability to identify all positives.
- **F1-Score**: A balance between precision and recall.
- **Support**: Number of instances in each class.

## Model Accuracy

Model accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to the total predictions made. It gives a general sense of how well the model predicts, but it may not tell the whole story, especially with imbalanced data.
